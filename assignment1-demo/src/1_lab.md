### Instructions

-   Do a lab write-up documenting your experience using Static Site Generation (SSG).

-   The submission will be a markdown document of approximate length 1-2 pages (300-600 words), although there are no marks allocated for number of words. 

-   Read about at least 3 different template engines.  List what you think might be pro's and con's of each.  Choose 1 to use in your assignment.  Explain your choice.

- Read about other SSG applications. List some pros/cons/features of each. We will primarily be using another one for your assignment you may do so. Describe why you would choose whichever tool. 

-   Are there other SSG applications (other than 11ty)?  Which ones are popular?  What do you think the pro's and con's of some of the other options might be?
yes. 

-   Read the configuration section of the 11ty documentation.  Which settings are we using and why?  Which settings exist that might be worth looking in to?

-   What is front matter?  How does it relate to the web?
